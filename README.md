pyshuffle
=========

Desktop application created in Python using PyQt framework. It's main purpouse is to serve as the tool for [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).

It was designed to work with similar application for mobile phones with Android operating system called [Shuffle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dodgybits.android.shuffle).
This fact influenced significant part of the application design.

Project was developed for my [Bachelor thesis](http://theses.cz/id/l3moo9). Large part of the application was recently rewritten and is still being improved.

__Features__:

* Complete equivalent of the Shuffle application
